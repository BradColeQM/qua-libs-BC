The active reset procedure is a good example of how the OPX can use feedback from
a measurement to feed-forward the state of a qubit. 
It tests the qubit state by performing a measurment and comparing the demodulated 
and itegrated in-phase signal to a threshold value. It then conditionally plays a 
pi pulse on that qubit.
