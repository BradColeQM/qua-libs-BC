Although pulse generation in QUA is arguably built around the concept of 
amplitude modulation (AM), the system is perfectly capable of performing frequency 
modulation. This is a powerful technique which can, for example be used to 
very flexibly generate a multi-tone signal. In this example, we show how a very compact,
100 point arbitrary waveform vector can be used to describe many frequencies 
spaced at a narrow bandwidth around an intermediate frequency (IF).
