# What to do first? 

If you're brand new, you can check out [hello-qua](/examples/basics/hello-qua) to get your first glimpse. 
Some more advanced usage in a "real world" scenario can be found in the [calibration](/examples/calibration) section
where [T1](/examples/calibration/T1), [T2](/examples/calibration/T2) and [Hahn-Echo](calibration/hahn-echo) examples can be found.
